                        <p className="text">   Let's face it, dating in NYC as a young modern woman is not easy. We work, we study, we have creers to worry about, and it gets lonely. 
                        It doesn't matter if you're looking for fun time or a long time, if you're in NYC, you probably have faced countless WTF moments.
                        NYC can be exciting and thrilling, but after many years dating in the city, and maybe few years of therapy, you ask yourself: is it me?
                        Let's try to find that answer together. </p>
                        <p className="text">I'm not saying that there are few of you who are totally guilty of your own dating distress, but my general answer for most of you is:
                        No, it's not you! In the next pages I'll share with you my take on NYC dating. You might agree, you might not, either way I wish you good luck in your dating journey in 
                        the city that never sleeps.</p>

                    <p className="text">I get it, not everyone is going to agree with me and my mental health can't handle the hate mail at the moment, 
                    thats why I feel forced to write the following: I made this site for fun, everything here but the statts is based in my personl opinion, experices and contributions from 
                    other women in my life.
                    No, I'm saying I hate men or that every men is the same. No, your experience does't hasve to be like mine, and no, you don't have to share my views.
                    But if you're curios about my experience and maybe want to laugh about it with me then, by all means, keep reading.</p>
                    <p className="text">Some things you need to know to understand a bit more where I'm coming from and things that might affect
                    my points of view in dating: I'm 34 years old, im heterosexual, I'm an inmigrant, my hectnicity is Hispanic/Latina, I'm college educated,
                    I'm a hustler, I moved to NYC about 8 years ago, I lived in different countries, I have parents from different background, I'm an only child,
                    I'm an introvert who learned how to be an extovert, I'm a huge overthinker, I have a dark sarcastic sense of humor, I have little patience,
                    English is not my first language, my career has taken me to different paths, some of them not very conventional, I was raised by a very 
                    strong woman and a very intelectual father, I'm very proud of my culture and values. </p>
                    <p className="text">Last but not least, I had 3 long relationships in my life: One in college that lasted about 4 years, the second one 
                    in my early 20sfor 3 years, and the last one in my late 20s/early 30s that lasted 4.5 years. All of them where different and made me learn a lot.
                    I've been single for about 2.5 years, and while I dated someone in those 2.5 years for few months, I'm not counting it because I don't think was deep enough.
                    I've been in many, many , many first dates, and I have learn a lot about NYC men. I also have a lot of male friends who had helped me to understand their mind to a deeper 
                    level... But don't get me wrong: NYC MEN STILL CONFUSE THE S%&$T ABOUT ME! </p>
